# Sample testbench for a Tiny Tapeout project

This is a sample testbench for a Tiny Tapeout project. It uses [cocotb](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/) to drive the DUT and check the outputs.
See below to get started or for more information, check the [website](https://tinytapeout.com/hdl/testing/).

## Setting up

1. Edit [Makefile](Makefile) and modify `PROJECT_SOURCES` to point to your Verilog files.
2. Edit [tb.v](tb.v) and replace `tt_um_example` with your module name.

## How to run

Do not use key as FF (1111_1111) as this is used to reset the LFSR

To run the RTL simulation:

```sh
make verilog
```
## How to cocotb:

Create a virtual environment, acrivate it and inside virtual environmrnt run:

```sh
make
```

## How to view the VCD file

Using GTKWave
```sh
gtkwave tb.vcd tb.gtkw
```

Using Surfer
```sh
surfer tb.vcd
```
